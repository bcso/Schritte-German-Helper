# Schritte-German-Helper
Practice your articles with the simple python script. Words are currently taken from LWS chapter 3 and 4 from book A1.1.

## About
This is a script I whipped up in a few minutes to help with practice - for now it serves my basic needs, will improve on it as time passes if necessary!

## Instructions
I assume you already have python installed, and can run simple scripts.

1. Clone the repo (or download it)

```git clone https://github.com/bcso/Schritte-German-Helper.git```

2. Run the script

```python article_practice.py```

3. Enter the respective articles for the specified words.

## Todo

- [ ] Add user input validation for articles
- [ ] Refactor words to seperate files
- [ ] Add other grammar practice
- [ ] Add more vocab (ongoing)
- [ ] Improve usability (ongoing)
